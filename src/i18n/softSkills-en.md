Soft skills exist in a more **personal and identity-based** dimension than hard skills. They are the abilities that allow us to interact with our environment and advance our **personal development**. Even if a person has excellent academic preparation, a lack of soft skills can affect their interactions with others and hinder their performance.

Fortunately, both soft and hard skills can be **learned and developed**. Soft skills are naturally acquired through interaction with others or through a conscious effort to **recognize and work** on our weaknesses. This capacity for self-assessment and continuous improvement is, in itself, an essential soft skill.

Below, I present interactively some of the skills that I consider important in my work as a **web developer**. The mastery levels of these skills represent my **personal perspective**. Lower levels are developed in personal or familial settings, while higher levels are applied and developed in organizational contexts, working on the skill in a more **collective, external, and systemic** manner.
